This code includes data-driven inversion and physics-driven inversion under openfwi
Folder Description
FWI: The storage location for physical inversion experimental results
invert_models: The place where the result storage is implemented data-driven
phy_data: Physical inversion experiment data that may be used
Split_Suzy: Inside is a txt file that stores the training data storage path, which is used when loading data for the model
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to download data: to the official openfwi or other data sources are also available
