# OpenFWI Benchmarks
> Pytorch Implementation on OpenFWI 2D datasets


## About

This repository officially supports the reproducibility of OpenFWI Benchmarks[[1]](#ref1). The mateirals will evolve with the further development of OpenFWI.

For the time being, it contains the codes for training and testing InversionNet[[2]](#ref2) and VelocityGAN[[3]](#ref3), and covers 10 datasets in __Vel family__, __Fault family__, and __Style family__.

## Prepare Data
First download any dataset from our [website](https://openfwi-lanl.github.io/docs/data.html#vel) and unzip it into your local directory.

### Load a pair of velocity map and seismic data
For any dataset in _Vel, Fault, Style_  family, the data is saved as `.npy` files, each file contains a batch of 500 samples. `datai.npy` refers to the `i-th` sample of seismic data. To load data and check:
```bash
import numpy as np
# load seismic data
seismic_data = np.load('data1.npy')
print(seismic_data.shape) #(500,5,1000,70)
# load velocity map
velocity_map = np.load('model1.npy')
print(velocity_map.shape) #(500,1,70,70)
```

### Prepare training and testing set
Note that there are many ways of organizing training and testing dataset, as long as it is compatible with the [DataLoader module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) in pytorch. Whichever way you choose, please refer to the following table for the train/test split.

| Dataset      | Train / test Split | Corresponding `.npy` files |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Vel Family     | 24k / 6k     | data(model)1-48.npy / data(model)49-60.npy |
| Fault Family   | 48k / 6k     | data(model)1-96.npy / data(model)97-108.npy |
| Style Family   | 60k / 7k     | data(model)1-120.npy / data(model)121-134.npy |


A convenient way of loading the data is to use a `.txt` file containing the _location+filename_ of all `.npy` files, parse each line of the `.txt` file and push to the dataloader. Take **flatvel-A** as an exmaple, we create `flatvel-a-train.txt`, organized as the follows, and same for `flatvel-a-test.txt`. 
```bash
Dataset_directory/data1.npy
Dataset_directory/data2.npy
...
Dataset_directory/data48.npy
```

**To save time, you can download all the text files from the `splitting_files` folder and change to your own directory.**

## Reproduce the OpenFWI Benchmarks
> For InversionNet and VelocityGAN, the current version supports training with a single GPU. For UPFWI and InversionNet3D, multiple-GPU is necessary due to the computation cost. 


### Environment setup
The following packages are required:
- pytorch v1.7.1
- torchvision v0.8.2
- scikit learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)

If you other versions of pytorch and torchvision, please make sure they align.

### InversionNet
To train from scratch on Flatvel-A dataset with $\ell_1$ loss,  run the following codes:
``` -ds flatvel-a -n YOUR_DIRECTORY -m InversionNet -g2v 0 --tensorboard -t flatvel_a_train.txt -v flatvel_a_val.txt
```

`-ds` specifies the dataset, `-n` creates the folder containing the saved model other log files, `-g2v` sets the coefficient of $\ell_2$ loss to be zero, `-t` and `-v` assign the training data and test data loading files.

To continue training from a saved checkpoint, run the following codes:
```
python train.py -ds flatvel-a -n YOUR_DIRECTORY -r CHECKPOINT.PTH -m InversionNet -g2v 0 --tensorboard -t flatvel_a_train.txt -v flatvel_a_val.txt
```

Please refer to the details of the codes if you would like to change other parameters (*learning rate,* etc.). These commands suffice to reproduce the OpenFWI benchmarks.

The last step would be testing, where we include the visualization. Also we borrow the implementation of SSIM metric from [pytorch-ssim](https://github.com/Po-Hsun-Su/pytorch-ssim). Please make sure that `pytorch-ssim.py` and `rainbow256.npy` are placed together with others.

```
python test.py -ds flatvel-a -n YOUR_DIRECTORY -m InversionNet -v flatvel_a_val.txt -r CHECKPOINT.PTH --vis -vb 2 -vsa 3
```

`--vis` enables the visualization and creates a folder with the figures, you may also change the amount of velocity maps by playing with `-vb` and `-vsa`.

### VelocityGAN
The code logic of VelocityGAN is almost identical the that of InversionNet.

To train from scratch on Flatvel-A dataset with $\ell_1$ loss, run the following codes:
```
python gan_train.py -ds flatvel-a -n YOUR_DIRECTORY -m InversionNet -g2v 0 --tensorboard -t flatvel_a_train.txt -v flatvel_a_val.txt
```
To continue training from a saved checkpoint, run the following codes:
```
python gan_train.py -ds flatvel-a -n YOUR_DIRECTORY -r CHECKPOINT.PTH -m InversionNet -g2v 0 --tensorboard -t flatvel_a_train.txt -v flatvel_a_val.txt
```
The command for testing is the same with InversionNet


## Future Updates
- We will release the training configuration of Kimberlina-CO2 dataset very soon.
- We will improve the instruction with illustrations and other necessary details
- The codes of UPFWI and InversionNet3D is pending approval, they will be added to this repo once approved.
